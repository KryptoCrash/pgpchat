Secure PGP Chat
===============

This project is just a kind of test and inspiration for you.
It creates for any chat user a PGP Key (Private / Public) and send the public Key to the server.

If another user is sending a message. The message will be individual encrypted
for any other chat member and will be send to him encrypted.

The login password changes every hour. You can get it by the getPassword URL.
It's recommended to change this URL in config.js ;-)

Hope you enjoy it, feel free to give me feedback!
